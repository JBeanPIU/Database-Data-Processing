Hi!

This repository is for all QAP's related to the Database & Data Processing course, provided by Keyin College as part of the Software Development course! So far I've only got QAP 1 and 2, but this will also include my midterm Sprint/final Sprint and 
QAP 3 too when it decides to pop out!

Take a look around, most of these assignments are done through PostgreSQL in case of any syntax errors, but that's also disclosed within the files themselves too.

Thanks!

Hi!

This is an assignment tackling QAP 1 for Database & Data Processing, the purpose of this assignment was to simulate a relational database schema based on a small online bookstore. The bookstore needs to be able to manage any information on the books, 
authors, customers, and orders.

In the JBooks.SQL, there are five design tables, one alter table that adds a foreign key from the Authors Table, and two junction tables used for the many types of book genres + order details.

There is a .pdf included that will be showing all of the information in this, alongside how they relate and why!

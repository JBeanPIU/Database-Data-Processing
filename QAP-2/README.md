Hi!

This is part of my submission for QAP 2 of Database & Data Processing, this assignment revolved around using SQL to create tables, inserting data and performing various queries to test system outputs.

For example, Juni.sql is based on a university course enrollment system, having to create tables on the following (students, professors, courses, enrollments), instering the data using at least 5 students,
4 profs, and 3 courses and testing queries to retrieve various bits of data. The first query involves retrieving the full names of all students enrolled in the "Physics 101" (which I named Hells Kitchen 101 oops)
program.

The second one involves a very similar pattern in terms of creating tables, data insertion, etc. but with slightly different queries required and based around an online store inventory & orders system.

Overall took a good few hours to fully create, and the JuniShop (only now realized it's not even based on the same problem, but name stays LOL) was done all in one go, so there's no real commit changes done to it

Thanks!
